# Project Euler Solutions

This repo is a collection of my code snippets to solve the project euler problems. As you can see not all the solutions are completed yet, I just try to push the code on a weekly basis. All the solution code is written in Javascript. Each solution snippet contains the problem description directly from the project euler description.

### What is Project Euler?

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 670 problems, with a new one added once every one or two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. As of June 2019, Project Euler has more than 900,000 users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler) )

### An answer is wrong!

If you get a wrong answer after running a code snippet (not altering my solution code), then you are more than welcome to let me know by opening a [new issue here](https://github.com/nfuad/project-euler-solutions/issues/new). Or even better, create a new Pull Request with your proposed solution and I would definitely check it out.
